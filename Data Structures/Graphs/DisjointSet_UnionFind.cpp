    "Disjoint Set or Union-Find is a data structure which is associated with the 'connectivity' of vertices..."

-> so basically, at first each vertex is in a set of its own
-> if it has an edge with another vertex, then these 2 vertices are put into the same set
-> 2 vertices are in the same set if they are in the same component
-> there are 2 functions for this ds

    -> Union: if suppose a new edge was found which connects 2 diff disjoin set, then we need to join these 2 sets
        -> Union by Rank
        -> Union by Size
    -> Find: this fx finds the parent or the representative of any set. if 2 vertices have the same parent, then that means that they belong to the same set and are connected.
