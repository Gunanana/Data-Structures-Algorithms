//its not a cycle when vertex A goes to visited vertex B but prior to this, A came from B, hence it was visited
//when vertex A goes to visited vertex B but A didnt come from B its cyclic then

STEPS:
1) 3 containers 1) visited hashmap, 2) parent hashmap, 3) queue
2) push, mark, note the initial vertex (push into q, mark as visited, note its parent)
3) put a while loop and do the following for all the vertices
4) pop vertex, call a for loop for all the adj vertices of this vertex. this x is the parent of all these adjacent vertices
                going from x-> i
5) 3 cases->1) i was not visited, so note x as p, mark and push i
            2) i was visited but i was the parent so no cycle yet
            3) i was visited but i was not x's parent, so cycle
