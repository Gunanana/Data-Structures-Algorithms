/*
int arr[]={1,2,4,5,5,5,6,7,7,8};
indices:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

-->lower bound is basically the first index (first appearance) of a number if it exists, if not, then its the index where it should have been.
ex: lowerbound of 5 is 3.
    lowerbound of 3 is 2
    lowerbound of 9 is 10 (the index greater than the last index for any number larger than the max element)


-->upper bound is the index after the last appearance of the number if it exists (or) which index the next same number would come and sit (or) (if it does not exist) then its index where it should have been.
ex: upperbound of 5 is 6
    upperbound of 3 is 2
    upperbound of 6 is 7
